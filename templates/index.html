    <h1> Welcome to QuizGen </h1>

    <p>Quizzes are a great way to test and aid a studentâ€™s understanding
        of a topic, as demonstrated by various studies. Setting up
        quizzes is time consuming since it requires considerations such as
        relevance to the topic, unambiguity, originality of the questions, and
        generation of distractors (choices) for MCQs. This project aims to
        design an end-to-end web application which can generate different
        formats of questions(MCQ,short answer). The models of abstractive
        summarizer and BERT-HLSQG are used for question generation and
        answering and wordsense, wordnet and conceptnet for distractor
        generation. Below is the high level diagram of the modules:</p>
